# FlowCrypt - with comments disabled

## What are we doing?
We are trying to disable comments that FlowCrypt adds to every message which look like this:
```sh
Version: FlowCrypt Email Encryption 8.4.2
Comment: Seamlessly send and receive encrypted email
```

## Build with Docker
```sh
docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/app --workdir /app --entrypoint bash node:lts-bullseye

yarn
yarn build
```

## Install on Chrome
```sh
cd build/chrome-consumer
zip -r flowcrypt.zip .
```
Then go to `chrome://extensions/` and load the extension from the zip file.

This project is written in TypeScript. Browsers only understand JavaScript, so the project needs to be transpiled. You need to build the project the first time you download it, and build it after each change you make to see the result in the browser. First, install tooling:

```bash
$ cd some/folder/flowcrypt-browser
$ npm install
```

To build the project (for now Linux and Mac only)

```
$ npm run-script build

> flowcrypt-browser@5.9.7 build /home/luke/git/flowcrypt-browser
> gulp

Now you can find your built project in `build/chrome-consumer` and `build/firefox-consumer`

Printing debug data to test logs can be done using special `Debug` class:

### Note for Mac OS users

In order for `npm run-script build` to work you have to:

1. Upgrade `bash` to v4 or higher and make the new version default: https://www.shell-tips.com/mac/upgrade-bash/

2. Install GNU `cp` util and make it default: https://stackoverflow.com/a/40431200/3049064
